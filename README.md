# Personal Relationship Management
### Like CRM, but PRM

PRM is an android application designed to allow people to track their personal and professional relationships regardless of the communication medium used. The ultimate goal of PRM would consist of an app that:

- Tracks phone, email, and text message interactions between two people
- Sets reminder frequency to meet or talk with specific people
- Aggregates social media information
- Integrates natural language processing and other machine learning techniques to assist with relationship management

Work in progress.
